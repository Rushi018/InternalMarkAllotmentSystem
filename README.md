# InternalMarkAllotmentSystem
Built a web app with C#, .NET Framework, and Microsoft SQL Server for Internal Mark Allotment System. Modules include Student (registration, activity submission) and Department (faculty login, mark allotment). Enables efficient student data management, seamless faculty-student communication, and viewable mark history and certificates.

# Details :

Developed an Internal Mark Allotment System using C#, .NET Framework, and Microsoft SQL Server. The Student Module facilitates registration and activity submission, granting access to a personalized portal upon successful login. In the Department Module, faculty log in using assigned credentials, proceeding to the mark allotment panel. Here, faculty members allocate marks to student submissions. Students can view their marks and certificates in the Student Panel's mark history section, enhancing communication and transparency between students and faculty. The system ensures secure data management and an efficient workflow for academic assessment.

# Tools :
1. C# .NET Framework for backend logic and application development.
2. SQL Server for robust and secure database connectivity.
3. Integrated development environment (IDE) for coding and testing, such as Visual Studio.
